<p>This is my personal website. I will try to create posts focusing on neuroimaging research. I chose to use the R package blogdown to create it because of these reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>R</li>
<li>familarity</li>
<li>community</li>
<li>visualizations</li>
<li>learn more R</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are online resources I referenced to create this website:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/"><code>blogdown</code>: Creating Websites with R Markdown</a> by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, and Alison Presmanes Hill</li>
<li><a href="https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/">Up &amp; Running with blogdown</a> by Alison Presmanes Hill</li>
<li><a href="https://annielyu.com/2020/01/12/blogdown-website/">Fun blogdown in R to design a personal website</a> by Annie Lyu</li>
<li><a href="https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/">hugo-academic docs</a></li>
<li><a href="google.com">google</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some useful files paths I encountered:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>data/themes/</code> is the directory for custom themes</li>
<li><code>layouts/partials/</code> is the directory for custom partial templates. This is how I changed the site footer. Default partials are in this directory: <code>themes/hugo-academic/layouts/partials/</code></li>
</ul>
<p>While creating the website, I learned there is a difference between <code>index.md</code> and <code>_index.md</code> files. <code>index.md</code> indicates a leaf bundle and <code>_index.md</code> a branch bundle. This <a href="https://scripter.co/hugo-leaf-and-branch-bundles/">blog post</a> gives more information about the differences between leaf and branch bundles.</p>
<p>In the future, I intend to finish reading the blogdown book and maybe look into learning some CSS. I also noticed some blogs with sun/moon button for changing day/night themes (<a href="https://radu-matei.com/blog/dark-mode/">example</a>). I will try to put this in my website and/or alter the theme.</p>
